## Abstract

*Purpose:*
Previous research showed conflicting results about mortality predictors in critically ill patients with hematological malignancies (HM). The primary aim of this study was to determine mortality in critically ill patients with HM in intensive care unit (ICU) and to reveal risk factors predicting the outcome.

*Methods and materials:*
All patients with HM admitted to ICU at our hospital during 1 year were enrolled. Clinical data upon ICU admission was collected and then outcomes were estimated.

*Results:*
ICU mortality was 52% among 98 HM patients.
According to multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.75, CI: 1.15–6.88, p = 0.026), high SOFA score (OR 1.30, CI: 1.07–1.62, p = 0.012) and high Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.30, CI: 1.06–1.64, p = 0.016) were associated with the outcome.

*Conclusion:*
We found three independent predictors for ICU mortality. Further research is
needed to validate current findings and reveal new mortality predictors in critically ill HM patients.

## Introduction

Patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) have an increased risk of death compared to other oncology patients in settings of intensive care unit (ICU). According to previous research1, the predictive value of different admission factors is constantly changing, and several studies on this topic have conflicting results.
Our research question is addressed to identifying factors in the condition of hematological patients that can predict a poor ICU outcome. The primary aim of this study was to determine ICU mortality and risk factors predicting the outcome of critically ill patients with HMs.
We hypothesized that there are some significant factors in the condition of HM patients at the moment of ICU admission that are associated with mortality.

## Methods

Our research is an observational, single-center study.
We retrospectively evaluated baseline characteristics of adult HM patients non-electively admitted to the medical ICU of our hospital from July 1, 2022 to June 30,2023. All the HM diagnoses were based on the pathological examination results or medical records. All data were obtained from a local ICU electronic database.
Cases with a critical amount of missing data, as well as those who died or
transferred to the floor within 24 hours were excluded from the study.

```{r, out.width="100%"}

```
Upon ICU admission, we included baseline patients’ information on demographic data, diagnosis, extent of organ dysfunction, comorbidity burden, presence of neutropenia, disease status and number of days in hospital prior to ICU referral. Based on above-mentioned information, independent variables were created, and the outcome of ICU hospitalization was set as a dependent variable (Table 1).

```{r}
df_variable <- colnames(original_data)

var_definition <- c(
  "anonymized identical number of patient",
  "gender of patient",
  "age of patient",
  "Charlson Comorbidity Index - most widely used scoring system for comorbidities",
  "type of hematological malignancy",
  "status of HM progression",
  "number of days in hospital before admission to ICU",
  "sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), is used  to determine the extent of organ function or rate of failure",
  "absolute neutrophil count < 1000 per mm3",
  "outcome (1 is death, 0 is survival)")

var_type <- c(
  "numerical",
  "categorical, binary",
  "numerical, years",
  "numerical, points",
  "categorical",
  "categorical: p (progression) - relapsed or refractory disease, n - newly diagnosed",
  "numerical, days",
  "numerical, points",
  "categorical, binary (1 = yes, 0 = no)",
  "categorical, binary (1 is death, 0 is survival)")



var_status <-  c(
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "independent",
  "dependent")
  
var_df <-  
bind_cols(df_variable, var_definition, var_type, var_status) %>% 
  rename( variable = '...1', definition = '...2', type = '...3', status = '...4')


var_df %>% kable()
#%>% flextable()

This study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the local ethics committee (date: 03.08.2023 / no: 1236). Since we performed a retrospective analysis of routinely collected de-identified data, informed consents from the patients were not required. The trial was registered.
All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2022).
Сontinuous variables were described as mean (standard deviation), median (25–75 percentiles) and range. We performed a univariate analysis first to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of mortality, and statistically significant factors were then used in a multivariate logistic regression model to determine outcome prediction. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was done for the final model. In this research, all the tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.


## Results

The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of all 98 patients are given in Table 2. The patients’ mean (SD) age was 64 (14) years, and just over half (55%) were females. Acute leukemia was the most frequent diagnosis (43%), followed by multiple myeloma (26%), then non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (18%). 48 (49%) of patients had refractory or relapsed disease status. 35 (36%) patients had neutropenia on admission. Median (IQR) time in the ward before admission to ICU was 11 (3, 20) days. Mean (SD) SOFA score on ICU referral was 6.38 (2.37) points, and Charlson Comorbidity Index was 6.1 (2.25) points.

  select(gender, age, cci, diagnosis,
         disease_status, days_bfr_icu,

  tbl_summary(     
    by = is_deceased,     # stratify entire table by outcome
    type = all_continuous() ~ "continuous2",

The ICU mortality was 52%. We performed univariate analysis (Table 3) to calculate the odds ratio of mortality for each of collected covariates (Table 3). All continuous variables were checked for linearity beforehand (Figure 2).

```{r}


original_data %>% 
  select(is_deceased, age, cci, sofa, days_bfr_icu) %>% 
  pivot_longer(all_of(c("age", "sofa", "sofa", "cci",
                        "days_bfr_icu")), names_to = "predictors") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = is_deceased)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  facet_wrap(~predictors, scales = "free_x")+
  labs ( title = "Fig.2  Checking numeric variables for linearity",
         subtitle = "All of the slopes are monotonic, i.e. linear")
  
```

Three statistically significant factors were identified in univariate model.

```{r}

uni_object <-  glm(is_deceased ~ gender + age + sofa + cci +
                       disease_status + days_bfr_icu, data = original_data, family = "binomial")


sjPlot:: tab_model(uni_object, 
                    show.intercept = FALSE,
                    show.aic = TRUE,
                    show.r2 = FALSE,
                    title = 'Results of univariate analysis of factors') 

```


Statistically significant variables were checked for multicollinearity (Table 4) and then included into a multivariate regression analysis (Table 5).

```{r}
dependent <- "is_deceased"
explanatory <- c("gender","cci", "sofa")
original_data %>% 
  glmmulti(dependent, explanatory) %>%
  car::vif() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  add_column(c("gender", "cci", "sofa")) %>% 
  rename(variable = 'c("gender", "cci", "sofa")', GVIF = ".") %>% 
  select(variable, everything()) %>% kable()

```


All of included factors - male sex (OR 2.75, CI: 1.15–6.88, p = 0.026), high SOFA score (OR 1.30, CI: 1.07–1.62, p = 0.012) and high Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.30, CI: 1.06–1.64, p = 0.016) were associated with outcome. 
Overall performance of multivariate model characterized by Akaike information criterion (AIC)124.71 and area under the curve (AUC) 0.74 (Figure 3).



```{r}

object <- glm(is_deceased ~ gender + sofa + cci, data = original_data, family = "binomial")

sjPlot:: tab_model(object, 
                    show.intercept = FALSE,
                    show.aic = TRUE,
                    show.r2 = FALSE,
                    title = 'Results of multivariate analysis of factors') 
```

                   axis.lim = c(0.99,10),
                   vline.color = 'red') +
  ylab("Odds ratio with confidence intervals")
```

## Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first observational study in Russia to report the prognostic value of condition and comorbidity factors related to ICU mortality in HM population.

We retrospectively evaluated admission data of 98 critically ill patients for prognostic factors for ICU outcome during a 1-year period. The ICU mortality rate in our sample was high (52%). Male sex, high SOFA and CCI scores were associated with ICU mortality both in univariate and multivariate analysis.

Mortality in our study corresponds to the average ICU mortality in previous studies. According to preceding research, ICU mortality in patients with HMs varied between 26 and 84.1%2. This wide range can be explained by differences in admission and discharge policy, severity of condition in study populations, geographic and socioeconomic factors3. We reassessed the prognostic significance of previously published factors for critically ill patients with HMs.

Our findings come in line with prior research in that the severity of organ failure and extent of comorbidity are associated with poor ICU outcomes4,5.
We did not reveal statistical significance of neutropenia and advanced disease status as prognostic factors, and it corroborates previous studies that defined these factors as controversial.

Our multivariate model revealed male sex as a significant prognostic factor for ICU mortality. At this point, we do not have a firm explanation of this result from neither background nor foreground knowledge, so this finding has to be validated.
This study has several limitations.

First, due to the retrospective nature of our study some data may have been missed. Second, as this is a single-center study, our findings can hardly be generalized to the entire population.

Third, due to the relatively small sample size we were unable to internally validate the outcome prediction model.

Fourth, our study did not estimate disease-specific factors, except for presence of progression or relapse.

Finally, due to variations in severity of cases, ICU admission and discharge policies, end-of-life-care protocols, we can not directly compare mortality rates to other studies.

## Conclusion

Our results demonstrated that critically ill patients with hematological malignancies have a high mortality.
We have found that severity of organ failure assessed by SOFA score, high comorbidity and male gender may have an impact on ICU mortality.
Prospective multicentre studies may help to explore validity of these results.
Other factors related to natural history and specific therapy for underlying malignancy need to be evaluated regarding their association to ICU outcomes.
